    "# Use AutoGen in Databricks with DBRX\n",
    "\n",
    "![DBRX launch](https://www.databricks.com/en-blog-assets/static/2fe1a0af1ee0f6605024a810b604079c/dbrx-blog-header-optimized.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In March 2024, Databricks released [DBRX](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm), a general-purpose LLM that sets a new standard for open LLMs. While available as an open-source model on Hugging Face ([databricks/dbrx-instruct](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-instruct/tree/main) and [databricks/dbrx-base](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-base) ), customers of Databricks can also tap into the [Foundation Model APIs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/score-foundation-models.html#query-a-chat-completion-model), which make DBRX available through an OpenAI-compatible, autoscaling REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) is becoming a popular standard for agent creation. Built to support any \"LLM as a service\" that implements the OpenAI SDK, it can easily be extended to integrate with powerful open source models. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate a few basic examples of Autogen with DBRX, including the use of  `AssistantAgent`, `UserProxyAgent`, and `ConversableAgent`. These demos are not intended to be exhaustive - feel free to use them as a base to build upon!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "AutoGen must be installed on your Databricks cluster, and requires `Python>=3.8`. This example includes the `%pip` magic command to install: `%pip install pyautogen`, as well as other necessary libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code has been tested on: \n",
    "* [Serverless Notebooks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/serverless.html) (in public preview as of Apr 18, 2024)\n",
    "* Databricks Runtime 14.3 LTS ML [docs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/release-notes/runtime/14.3lts-ml.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "This code can run in any Databricks workspace in a region where DBRX is available via pay-per-token APIs (or provisioned throughput). To check if your region is supported, see [Foundation Model Region Availability](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/model-serving-limits.html#foundation-model-apis-limits). If the above is true, the workspace must also be enabled by an admin for Foundation Model APIs [docs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/foundation-models/index.html#requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "* This notebook can be imported from github to a Databricks workspace and run directly. Use [sparse checkout mode with git](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/01/26/work-large-monorepos-sparse-checkout-support-databricks-repos.html) to import only this notebook or the examples directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Databricks recommends using [Secrets](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secrets.html) instead of storing tokens in plain text. \n",

Other subsets of AI include rule-based systems, machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep learning, on the other hand, is a specific approach to building AI systems that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. In deep learning, we use artificial neural networks, which are composed of interconnected nodes or \"neurons,\" to learn patterns in data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep learning has been particularly successful in recent years due to several factors, including the availability of large amounts of data, powerful computational resources, and advances in neural network architectures and training algorithms. As a result, deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of tasks, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.\n",

However, it is just one of many approaches to building AI systems, and it is important to understand the broader context of AI in order to fully appreciate the potential and limitations of deep learning.\n",

MLflow provides a number of features to help data scientists and machine learning engineers manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including:\n",
