      "\n",
      "FLAML has integrated Spark for distributed training. There are two main aspects of integration with Spark:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Use Spark ML estimators for AutoML.\n",
      "- Use Spark to run training in parallel spark jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Spark ML Estimators\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. These models are trained in parallel using Spark, so we called them Spark estimators. To use these models, you first need to organize your data in the required format.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Data\n",
      "\n",
      "For Spark estimators, AutoML only consumes Spark data. FLAML provides a convenient function `to_pandas_on_spark` in the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark (`pyspark.pandas`) dataframe/series, which Spark estimators require.\n",
      "\n",
      "This utility function takes data in the form of a `pandas.Dataframe` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. It also takes `pandas.Series` or `pyspark.sql.Dataframe` and converts it into a [pandas-on-spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/index.html) series. If you pass in a `pyspark.pandas.Dataframe`, it will not make any changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This function also accepts optional arguments `index_col` and `default_index_type`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `index_col` is the column name to use as the index, default is None.\n",
      "- `default_index_type` is the default index type, default is \"distributed-sequence\". More info about default index type could be found on Spark official [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/options.html#default-index-type)\n",

This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n",
      "- `n_concurrent_trials`: int, default=1 | The number of concurrent trials. When n_concurrent_trials > 1, FLAML performes parallel tuning.\n",
