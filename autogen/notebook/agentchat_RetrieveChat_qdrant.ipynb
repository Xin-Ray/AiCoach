In this notebook, we demonstrate how to utilize RetrieveChat to generate code and answer questions based on customized documentations that are not present in the LLM's training dataset.

      "## What is FLAML\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAML is a lightweight Python library for efficient automation of machine\n",
      "learning and AI operations. It automates workflow based on large language models, machine learning models, etc.\n",
      "and optimizes their performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "- FLAML enables building next-gen GPT-X applications based on multi-agent conversations with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation and optimization of a complex GPT-X workflow. It maximizes the performance of GPT-X models and augments their weakness.\n",
      "- For common machine learning tasks like classification and regression, it quickly finds quality models for user-provided data with low computational resources. It is easy to customize or extend. Users can find their desired customizability from a smooth range.\n",
      "- It supports fast and economical automatic tuning (e.g., inference hyperparameters for foundation models, configurations in MLOps/LMOps workflows, pipelines, mathematical/statistical models, algorithms, computing experiments, software configurations), capable of handling large search space with heterogeneous evaluation cost and complex constraints/guidance/early stopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAML is powered by a series of [research studies](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research/) from Microsoft Research and collaborators such as Penn State University, Stevens Institute of Technology, University of Washington, and University of Waterloo.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAML has a .NET implementation in [ML.NET](http://dot.net/ml), an open-source, cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installation\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAML requires **Python version >= 3.8**. It can be installed from pip:\n",
