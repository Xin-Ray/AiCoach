# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Prerequisites

To build and test documentation locally, begin by downloading and installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and then installing [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/).
On Windows, you can install via the npm package manager (npm) which comes bundled with Node.js:

```console
npm install --global yarn
```

## Installation

```console
pip install pydoc-markdown pyyaml colored
cd website
yarn install
```

### Install Quarto

`quarto` is used to render notebooks.

Install it [here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases).

> Note: Ensure that your `quarto` version is `1.5.23` or higher.

## Local Development

Navigate to the `website` folder and run:

```console
pydoc-markdown
python ./process_notebooks.py render
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
