    "# Using Gemini in AutoGen with Other LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Install AutoGen with Gemini features:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyautogen[gemini]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how to use Gemini in AutoGen alongside other tools. Install the necessary dependencies with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyautogen[gemini,retrievechat,lmm]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no need to handle OpenAI or Google's GenAI packages separately; AutoGen manages all of these for you. You can easily create different agents with various backend LLMs using the assistant agent. All models and agents are readily accessible at your fingertips. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Distinctions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Currently, Gemini does not include a \"system_message\" field. However, you can incorporate this instruction into the first message of your interaction.\n",
    "- If no API key is specified for Gemini, then authentication will happen using the default google auth mechanism for Google Cloud. Service accounts are also supported, where the JSON key file has to be provided."

      "**Product Name:** VisionAid\n",
      "\n",
      "**Target Audience:** People with vision disabilities\n",
      "\n",
      "**Product Concept:** A comprehensive and multimodal software platform that empowers individuals with vision impairments by providing them with essential information about their surroundings through image recognition and localization.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Product Design and Implementation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Image Acquisition:**\n",
      "* The platform utilizes a camera or other image acquisition device to capture images of the user's surroundings.\n",
      "* The device can be integrated into a smartphone, wearable device, or smart home appliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Image Processing:**\n",
      "* The captured image is preprocessed to optimize the performance of the computer vision model.\n",
      "* This includes scaling, cropping, and enhancing the image for better recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Object Detection and Localization:**\n",
      "* The Gemini computer vision model is then employed to analyze the preprocessed image.\n",
      "* The model identifies the presence of objects in the image and determines their location with bounding boxes and spatial descriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Multimodal Output:**\n",
      "* **Audio Output:** The platform provides detailed audio descriptions of the detected objects and their locations.\n",
      "* **Haptic Output:** Haptic feedback is used to convey the spatial arrangement of objects through vibrations or tactile sensations.\n",
      "* **Visual Output (for partial vision):** If the user has partial vision, the platform can provide a simplified visual representation of the detected objects and their locations on a screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Accessibility and Customization:**\n",
      "* The platform is designed to be highly accessible, with adjustable settings for audio volume, haptic intensity, and visual contrast.\n",
      "* Users can customize the output to suit their individual preferences and needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Innovative Features:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Real-Time Object Detection:** The platform operates in real-time, providing continuous feedback about the user's surroundings as they move.\n",
      "* **Scene Interpretation:** Advanced algorithms analyze the relationship between objects and provide contextual descriptions. For example, the platform can differentiate between a stove and a coffee maker.\n",
      "* **Integration with Assistive Technology:** The platform can be integrated with other assistive technologies, such as screen readers and navigation apps, to enhance the user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits for Users with Vision Disabilities:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Improved Spatial Awareness:** The platform empowers users to navigate their environment confidently and independently.\n",
      "* **Enhanced Safety:** By identifying hazards and obstacles, the platform helps users avoid accidents and stay safe.\n",
      "* **Increased Independence:** The platform allows users to perform daily tasks and engage in activities that would otherwise be challenging with limited vision.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Additional Innovative Features:**\n",
